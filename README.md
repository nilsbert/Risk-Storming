# Scaled Agile Risk Storming Set

## Overview
The Scaled Agile Risk Storming Set is a collection of game cards designed to facilitate risk identification and management in scaled Agile environments. The goal is to provide teams with a tool to reflect on why Backlog Items and Goals are considered risky and why they may not be able to commit to them. **This is version 0.1, and we encourage you to provide feedback.**
